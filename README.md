# 🏨Comparative Analysis of Airbnb Listings: Chicago Vs New Orleans
## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a capstone analysis of Airbnb listings in **Chicago** and **New Orleans**, focusing on understanding differences in pricing, availability, host behaviors, and guest ratings. The goal is to provide actionable insights for hosts, travelers, and platform stakeholders.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Airbnb hosts and potential investors often lack city-specific insights into pricing, availability, and customer satisfaction.  
This project addresses that gap by offering a side-by-side analysis of two distinct Airbnb markets, enabling better-informed decisions for both hosts and travelers.

The project uses **cleaned Excel datasets** and interactive visualizations built in **Tableau**.  
Final deliverables include three interactive dashboards:
1. **KPIs & Property Analysis** – Total listings, acceptance rate, instant booking count, average price, number of Superhosts, property distribution.
2. **Price Analysis** – Price trends by room type, location and Superhost status
3. **Host Analysis** – Verified Hosts, Superhost performance, review scores, and availability comparisons.
